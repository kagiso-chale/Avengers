        <h1>About the Avengers (MCU Version)</h1>
        <p>
        The Avengers are a legendary team of superheroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), assembled to protect the 
        Earth from threats beyond the reach of any single hero. Introduced in 2012's <b>The Avengers</b>, they quickly became a
         central pillar of the MCU, playing crucial roles in some of the most dramatic and high-stakes events in cinematic 
         history.
        </p>

        <h1>Origins: The Avengers Initiative</h1>
        <p>
        The idea for the Avengers began with Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., after recognizing that Earth faced 
        increasing threats from other worlds. Following encounters with the Destroyer in <b>Thor (2011)</b> and the emergence 
        of individuals like Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, Fury began quietly assembling a team of extraordinary individuals.
         This became known as the "Avengers Initiative."
        </p>

        <p>
        The tipping point came when Loki stole the Tesseract and threatened the planet. Fury activated the Initiative, 
        bringing together a group that didn't initially see eye-to-eye — but through shared struggle, they became Earth's 
        mightiest heroes.

            <h1>Major Events and Turning Points</h1>
            <h2>The Battle of New York <b>(The Avengers, 2012)</b></h2>
            <p>
            The team's first mission united them against Loki and the Chitauri invasion. It proved they could work 
            together and showed the world the power of a united superhero force.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. <b>(Captain America: The Winter Soldier, 2014)</b></h2>
            
            <p>
            The Avengers realized they couldn't trust global institutions. This marked a turning point in how they 
            operated — independently, but with a sense of global responsibility.
            </p>
            <h2>The Sokovia Incident and Civil War <b>(Age of Ultron, Civil War)</b></h2>
            <p>
            After Ultron's creation led to the destruction of Sokovia, governments demanded oversight. The team split, 
            with half supporting the Sokovia Accords and the other resisting. The rift weakened them when they needed 
            each other most.
            </p>
            <h2>The Infinity War and the Blip <b>(Infinity War, Endgame)</b></h2>
            <p>
            Despite their efforts, the Avengers failed to stop Thanos from erasing half of all life. Five years later, 
            they reunited for one last mission — the Time Heist. This led to Tony Stark's death and Steve Rogers' 
            retirement.
            </p>
            <h1>Legacy and Beyond</h1>
            <p>
            The original Avengers may be gone or scattered, but their impact continues. Sam Wilson now wears the shield 
            as the new Captain America. Young heroes are stepping forward, and new threats loom large with the multiverse 
            unravelling.
            </p>
            <p>
            In future films like <b>Avengers: The Kang Dynasty</b> and <b>Avengers: Secret Wars</b>, their legacy will 
            continue to shape the MCU.
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>The Avengers are not just a team — they are a symbol of resilience, sacrifice, and hope in a universe full 
                of uncertainty.</b>
